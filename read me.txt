Original Work: DangerZone - Monster Spawning Lighting Aide
http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs/1245852-16x-1-7-dangerzone-monster-spawning-lighting-aide

Requires Optifine.

This Resource Pack will alter minecraft's lighting to show you exactly where monsters can and can't spawn.
Red = Dangerous: All monsters can spawn here
Purple = Safe: Nearly all monsters cannot spawn here (Silverfish & Blaze can still spawn in this zone)
Green = Very Safe: All mobs that rely on light-levels cannot spawn here

==========
2014-12-29 Modified JAO
Purple and Green removed.
Applies Red to blocks with light level less than 8 (monsters can spawn).
